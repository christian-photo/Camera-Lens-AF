## Important Note!
**Test the plugin before you use it in your imaging runs, because this plugin may not work for everyone! This plugin doesn't work with ASCOM.DSLR unfortuantely!**  
If you have questions/feedback/issues, you can ask on the [NINA discord](https://discord.com/invite/nighttime-imaging) in #plugin-discussions, take a look in the [wiki](https://github.com/rennmaus-coder/Camera-Lens-AF/wiki) or create an issue [here](https://github.com/rennmaus-coder/Camera-Lens-AF/issues)


**Requirements**:  
- A Canon Camera,  
- A Camera Lens that supports AF
- The plugin only runs in the advanced sequencer and the imaging tab

The plugin was tested using the following camera and lenses:
- Canon EOS 600d
- Canon EF 100-400 f/4.5-5.6 L IS USM
- Canon EF 24-105 f/4 L IS USM

## Manual Focus Control controls
- Mousewheel/Trackpad: Zoom in/out
- Left mousebutton: Pan around
- Right mousebutton: reset


Known issues:
- Some cameras or lenses may try to refocus, when taking images if the lens is set to AF




#Troubleshooting:
What to try if:
- ...the focus doesn't move: Try a different step size (2 always worked for me) or try switching your lens from AF/MF to MF/AF
- ...the plugin didn't result in good focus: Try a different step size (2 always worked for me)")]
