If you have questions/feedback/issues, you can ask on the [NINA discord](https://discord.com/invite/nighttime-imaging) in #plugin-discussions or create an issue [here](https://github.com/rennmaus-coder/Camera-Lens-AF/issues)


**Requirements**:  
- A Canon Camera,  
- A Camera Lens that supports AF

The plugin was tested using the following camera and lenses (Note that there are often issues with third-party lenses, so be aware of that):
- Canon EOS 600d
- Canon EF 100-400 f/4.5-5.6 L IS USM
- Canon EF 24-105 f/4 L IS USM

## Manual Focus Control controls (The Manual Focus Control does not affect the focuser position!)
- Mousewheel/Trackpad: Zoom in/out
- Left mousebutton: Pan around
- Right mousebutton: reset


Known issues:
- Some lenses may try to refocus, when taking images if the lens is set to AF")]
